# Real-time identification of flying objects

Generic model for real-time detection of objects
Flying can be used to transfer learning and research
More research, as well as a refined model is ready to go
perform

First, the model is trained
on a dataset containing 80 classes
different objects.
Then, the model is refined
on a representative data set
realistic environment

Detection of flying objects is common
challenges, including: spatial size object aspect ratio change speed, occlusion, and cluster background.

In an effort to find trade-offs
best between speed and accuracy,
YOLOv8 model is used.

## Installation instructions

**Step 1.** Clone the Repository

   First, clone the repository containing the application source code.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anhhducnguyen/Aircraft-Identification-v2
   ```

**Step 2.** Use Google Colab

  Navigate to the `Google Colab` page at [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
  
  Open the latest version of the `.ipynb` file with `Google Colab` to perform the experiment
